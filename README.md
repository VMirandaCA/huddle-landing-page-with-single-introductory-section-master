# huddle-landing-page-with-single-introductory-section-master!

The objective of the project was to create a message home page with the logo, and a brief summary of the page. the objectives were:

*Create the register button and make it change color when hovering the mouse; put social networks at the bottom of the page; 
*Place the huddle logo in the upper left corner; 
*Make the page responsive for 1440px and 375px screens.

_My observations about the project:

I had a little difficulty working with the images in svg because until then I had only worked with png and pjg, I still didn't quite understand how to adjust the image with my background and adjust the image as the moblie background , but it was good to do the project because we will not always work with the same image format.
